**As an entrepreneur, I’ve been there. From the starting line, excited and scared, taking that big leap into possibility, to the incredible overwhelm that comes with trying to manage and grow a successful business. It’s the kind of pressure that can make or break you. And it’s the kind of stress that can make you want to curl up in the fetal position and tap out of the entrepreneurial game once and for all!**

It’s times like these when going back to a corporate job doesn’t sound half bad. The punch in, punch out, kind of job where you don’t have to think too much, where the coffee’s always hot, and there’s plenty of co-workers to gossip with about the latest episode of Scandal... Yeah, those days can feel pretty dreamy when things are hard.

But being your own boss, making great money while doing something that you love, and getting to give back in ways you never could before is priceless!

So when you feel like giving up, here are three things to keep you going.

## 1. Focus On Your Purpose
When we’re feeling drained in our business, it’s often because we’ve lost our focus. So realigning with your purpose is key. Your purpose is what you stand for, it’s what you believe in, and it’s the bigger reason for why you do what you do.

Keeping your purpose at the heart of your business will serve as an unwavering beacon that will guide you through the hard stuff. Including the doubt and fear that can creep in as you grow!

## 2. Know That It’s Not Easy But Worth It
A lot of entrepreneurs start a business thinking that it’s going to be fun. They get to create their own schedule, say yes to awesome people and projects, and do what they love each and every day – I mean let’s get real, there’s nothing better than that part of owning a business right?

But what many entrepreneurs don’t anticipate, is the inevitable struggle that lies ahead.

They start their journey staring at the shiny summit of opportunity and freedom, but somehow miss that there’s an entire mountain standing in front of them, and it’s going to take a lot of blood, sweat, and tears to reach the top.

We have to commit to the journey ahead and embrace the challenge as a part of the process. Because when we go all in with the understanding that there will be setbacks and obstacles, we let the road ahead to refine us rather than tear us down.

## 3. Take a Break
Finally, when things seem too overwhelming, allow yourself to throw in the towel ― for a day. As entrepreneurs we tend to have endless to do lists and we are so caught up with every detail of our business, that most of us don’t even realize that we’re running on fumes until we have a complete breakdown.

So go ahead, close the 42 browser tabs on your computer, shut off your phone, and take a day off. Open your window, take a walk, grab some coffee, write in a journal, and even close your eyes if you can.

By stepping away from your work temporarily you not only allow your body to reset, but you are also able look in on our business from a new vantage point, often shedding light on priorities and goals.
